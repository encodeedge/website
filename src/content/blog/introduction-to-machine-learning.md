# Introduction to Machine Learning

#### Definition :&#x20;

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that allows computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

#### Key Idea :

Instead of explicitly programming rules (as in expert systems), ML algorithms identify patterns in data and improve performance over time.

In short, Machine Learning is similar to a mathematical function, it takes input data, predicts an output and provides a response.

Types of Machine Learning :

1. **Supervised Learning** : The model is trained on a labeled dataset where the desired output is known.
2. **Unsupervised Learning** : The model works on an unlabeled dataset, trying to identify hidden patterns.
3. **Reinforcement Learning** : The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving awards and penalties&#x20;

**How does Machine Learning works?**

**What are different Machine Learning Problems?**

1. **Regression** : Predict Continuous values e.g. predict stock prices. These regression problems can be further divided into

   &#x20; – Simple Linear Regression

   &#x20; – Multiple Linear Regression

   &#x20; – Non Linear Regression
2. **Classification** : Classify the data points based on the features of the classes in the data points. Some classifications techniques are.&#x20;

   – KNN

   – Naive Bayes

   – Logistic Regression
3. **Clustering :**  Partitioning the data into clusters based on feature similarity.

   – K-Means clustering

   – Hierarchical clustering

**Calculus** : Helps in optimizing algorithms by finding maximum and minimum points (e.g. cost function optimization in gradient descent, backpropagation in Neural Networks).

**Probability and Statistics** : Machine Learning often makes predictions under uncertainty and probability theory provides the mathematical formula (Algorithms like Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network, Markov Decision Process).

**Linear Algebra** : Data is often represented as matrices or vectors (e.g. dot product, matrix multiplication, eigen values, eigen vectors are fundamentals in algorithms like PCA).
